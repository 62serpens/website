    <h1>The Music Wheel: A Better System for DJs and Musicians</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>The Circle of Fifths is the backbone of music theory—it's been around for centuries and forms the foundation of how we understand key relationships. But current DJ systems like the Camelot Wheel have rotated and rebranded it, making music theory unnecessarily confusing for DJs and creating tension between DJs and traditionally trained musicians.</p>
        <p><strong>Why was it changed?</strong> The Camelot Wheel was developed by Mixed In Key and rotated specifically so it could be copyrighted and included in their software. Since you can't copyright the Circle of Fifths itself, they altered it to make it "unique." The result: a confusing system with random color choices that makes learning harder than it needs to be.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Solution: The Music Wheel</h2>
        <p>A unified, open-source system that combines three things everyone already understands:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Circle of Fifths</strong> - in its traditional orientation with C major at the top</li>
            <li><strong>A Clock Face</strong> - numbered 1-12, because everyone knows how to read a clock</li>
            <li><strong>A 12-Color Rainbow</strong> - starting with red at 12 o'clock, following the established order</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Clear labeling: <strong>A for major keys, B for minor keys</strong> (because major is primary—it just makes sense).</p>
        <p>This system is intuitive, easy to remember, and helps DJs learn actual music theory instead of working around a proprietary system.</p>

        <h2>Things to Consider</h2>
        <p><strong>"If it ain't broke, don't fix it"</strong><br>
        Fair point, but this <em>is</em> broken. The current system makes music theory harder than it should be. A streamlined, open-source approach benefits everyone long-term.</p>
        <p><strong>About the colors and synesthesia</strong><br>
        I'm not claiming keys <em>sound</em> like specific colors—musical colors are subjective. The rainbow is simply a reference point that's easy to remember. I considered using a traditional 7-color rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), but the standardized 12-color rainbow gives each key its own distinct color, which is cleaner.</p>
        <p><strong>Why A for major and B for minor?</strong><br>
        The traditional Camelot system uses B for major and A for minor, which feels backwards. Major is more primary, so A makes intuitive sense. If the B/♭ confusion becomes an issue, these could be swapped for X/Y, but the current version works well.</p>
