    <h1>The Music Wheel: A Better Way</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why the Current System Sucks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Circle of Fifths:</strong> You keep that the circle of fifths is music’s backbone. C major should be at the top. It should not be spun around for any reason. It makes learning music confusing and unnecessarily difficult for DJs. The reason it was rotated was a business/copyright issue which will be explained below.</li>
            <li><strong>Use a Clock Face:</strong> Everyone understands a clock.</li>
            <li><strong>Unify Colour System That Makes Sense:</strong> We will use the established colours of a 12-coloured rainbow in the correct order. Putting red at the top makes a lot more sense. Easier to remember, more intuitive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Solution: The Music Wheel</h2>
        <p>Toss all that out and turn it into this. A system that combines the circle of fifths, a clock face, and a 12-color rainbow. C major at 12 o’clock, numbered 1-12, red at the top, and clear labels (A for major, B for minor). It’s intuitive, open-source, and built for DJs and musicians to actually understand music theory.</p>

        <h2>Why the Camelot Wheel Is a Mess</h2>
        <p>The Camelot Wheel was created by a staff member at Mixed In Key. They wanted to copyright it, but you can’t copyright the circle of fifths—it’s universal knowledge. So, they spun it around to make it “unique,” which just made it confusing for no reason. The color choices? Random and ugly. The whole thing’s a branded product when it should be open-source knowledge.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Potential Issues</h2>
        <p>I get the saying “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” but this *is* broken. The current system makes music theory harder than it needs to be. A streamlined, open-source system like the Music Wheel would be better for music culture and education moving forward. Also, I’m not saying keys *sound* like rainbow colors—it’s just an easy way to remember and reference them. I know some folks with synesthesia might see it differently, and that’s cool. I also considered using the seven-color rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet) for simplicity, but a 12-color rainbow gives each key its own distinct color, which is cleaner than mushing them together. Oh, and I swapped A and B (A for major, B for minor) because it feels more intuitive—major as A just clicks better.</p>
